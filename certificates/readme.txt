Ancillary files for the manuscript "K2-Hamiltonian Graphs: II"
--------------------------------------------------------------

The following files are included:

- dot-product-conditions-proof.g6: This file contains the nine K2-hypohamiltonian snarks used in the proof of Theorem 6. They are represented in graph6 format. 

- dot-product-conditions-proof.txt: This file shows that the nine K2-hypohamiltonian snarks used in the proof of Theorem 6 satisfy the appropriate conditions. We start by stating the order of the graph and then giving its adjacency list. For all except the graph of order 20, we then mention the pair for which it satisfies conditions (iv) - (vi) of Theorem 5 and prove it satisfies the conditions by giving all necessary paths and/or cycles. For the graph of order 20 (flower snark J5), we also do this but we first give a pair of independent edges for which it satisfies conditions (i) - (iii) and prove this by giving all necessary paths and/or cycles. We then give a pair of vertices for the graph satisfies the conditions of Lemma 6 as well as all necessary paths and cycles. Finally, we do the same as for the other graphs.

- ext-cyc-proofs-cubic-graphs.g6: This file contains the ten cubic K2-hypohamiltonian graphs used in the proof of Theorem 4. They are represented in graph6 format.

- ext-cyc-proofs-cubic-graphs.txt: This file shows that the ten cubic K2-hypohamiltonian graphs used in the proof of Theorem 4 contain an extendable 5-cycle. We start by stating the order of the graph and then giving its adjacency list. We then give a 5-cycle and ten paths proving it is extendable.

- ext-cyc-proofs-planar-graphs.g6: This file contains the five planar K2-hypohamiltonian graphs used in the proof of Theorem 7 and depicted in Figure 6. They are represented in graph6 format.

- ext-cyc-proofs-planar-graphs.txt: This file shows that the five planar K2-hypohamiltonian graphs used in the proof of Theorem 7 contain an extendable 5-cycle. We start by stating the order of the graph and then giving its adjacency list. We then give a 5-cycle and ten paths proving it is extendable.
